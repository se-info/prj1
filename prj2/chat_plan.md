Okay, here's a PLAN.md file based on the PRD you provided. This plan breaks down the development into manageable phases and tasks.

# PLAN.md: Local IP Chat Room Development

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the development plan for the "Local Network Chat Room" application as specified in the PRD. The goal is to deliver a functional chat application with the core features: text chat, nickname requirement, emoji/sticker support, picture sending, and user activity logging.

## 2. Technology Stack (Assumptions)

*   **Backend (Server-side):**
    *   Language: Python (e.g., using `socket` module, or Flask/FastAPI with WebSockets for a web-based client) or Node.js (e.g., using `net` module or Express with Socket.IO).
    *   We will assume a simple client-server model where one instance acts as the host/server.
*   **Frontend (Client-side):**
    *   If Desktop: Python with Tkinter/PyQt, or Electron (HTML/CSS/JS).
    *   If Web-based: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
*   **Data Exchange:** JSON for messages.
*   **Logging:** Plain text files.

## 3. Development Phases

---

### Phase 0: Project Setup & Core Networking (MVP Foundation)

**Goal:** Establish the basic client-server communication, nickname entry, and the ability to send/receive a single text message.

*   **Tasks:**
    *   `[ ]` Set up project structure (folders, basic files).
    *   `[ ]` Initialize version control (Git).
    *   `[ ]` **Server:** Implement basic TCP server socket to listen for connections.
    *   `[ ]` **Client:** Implement basic TCP client socket to connect to the server.
    *   `[ ]` **Nickname (FR1.1, FR1.2):**
        *   `[ ]` Client: Implement UI prompt for nickname input upon connection.
        *   `[ ]` Client: Send nickname to server.
        *   `[ ]` Server: Receive nickname.
        *   `[ ]` Server: Implement basic logic to ensure chat is disabled until nickname is set (client-side enforcement initially, server-side validation later).
    *   `[ ]` **Basic Text Message:**
        *   `[ ]` Client: Input field and "Send" button for a single text message.
        *   `[ ]` Client: Send the text message to the server (include nickname).
        *   `[ ]` Server: Receive the message.
        *   `[ ]` Server: Broadcast the message back to the connected client (for now, just echo).
        *   `[ ]` Client: Display the received message in a very basic way.

        *   `[ ]` Server: Maintain a list of active nicknames.
        *   `[ ]` Server: Validate new nicknames for uniqueness, length, and characters. Send error back to client if invalid.
        *   `[ ]` Client: Handle nickname error from server and re-prompt.
    *   `[ ]` **Multi-User Chat (FR2.1, FR2.2, FR2.3):**
        *   `[ ]` Server: Manage multiple client connections.
        *   `[ ]` Server: Broadcast messages from one client to all other connected clients.
        *   `[ ]` Client: Improve chat display area (chronological, scrollable).
        *   `[ ]` Client: Display sender's nickname and timestamp with each message.
    *   `[ ]` **User List (US8):**
        *   `[ ]` Server: Send updated user list to clients when users join/leave.
        *   `[ ]` Client: Display a list of currently connected users.
    *   `[ ]` **Logging - Join/Leave (FR5.1, FR5.2, FR5.4, FR5.5):**
        *   `[ ]` Server: Implement function to log user join event (nickname, timestamp) to a text file.
        *   `[ ]` Server: Implement function to log user leave/disconnect event (nickname, timestamp) to a text file.
        *   `[ ]` Server: Ensure log file naming convention (e.g., `chat_log_YYYYMMDD.txt`).
    *   `[ ]` **Logging - Chat Messages (FR5.3):**
        *   `[ ]` Server: Log every text message (sender, timestamp, content) to the same text file.

        *   `[ ]` Client: Allow emojis in the message input field.
        *   `[ ]` Client: Ensure emojis render correctly in the chat display.
        *   `[ ]` Server: Handle messages containing emojis (usually no special handling needed if UTF-8 is used).
    *   `[ ]` **Sticker Support (FR3.3, FR3.4):**
        *   `[ ]` Define a small, predefined set of stickers (image files).
        *   `[ ]` Client: Implement a sticker picker UI.
        *   `[ ]` Client: Send a sticker identifier/filename when a sticker is selected.
        *   `[ ]` Server: Relay sticker identifier/filename to other clients.
        *   `[ ]` Client: Render the selected sticker in the chat display (e.g., by referencing local sticker assets or transferring small images).
        *   `[ ]` Server: Log sticker usage (FR5.3).
    *   `[ ]` **Picture Sending (FR4.1, FR4.2, FR4.3, FR4.4, FR4.5):**
        *   `[ ]` Client: Implement a button/mechanism to select an image file.
        *   `[ ]` Client: Implement client-side validation for file size and type.

*   **Tasks:**
    *   `[ ]` **UI Refinement (NFR1):**
        *   `[ ]` Improve layout, styling, and visual appeal of the chat interface.
        *   `[ ]` Ensure intuitive navigation and clear calls to action.
    *   `[ ]` **Error Handling & User Feedback:**
        *   `[ ]` Client: Clearer error messages (e.g., "Server not found," "Nickname taken," "File too large").
        *   `[ ]` Server: Robust handling of unexpected client disconnections.
        *   `[ ]` Client: Graceful handling of server disconnection.
        *   `[ ]` Visual feedback for sending messages, connecting, etc.
    *   `[ ]` **Configuration:**
        *   `[ ]` Allow server host/port to be configurable (e.g., via command-line argument or a simple config file for the server).
        *   `[ ]` Client should allow input of server IP/port.

### Phase 4: Testing & Refinement

**Goal:** Ensure all features work as expected, the application is stable, and logs are correct.

*   **Tasks:**
    *   `[ ]` **Functional Testing:**
        *   `[ ]` Test all user stories (US1-US8).

    *   `[ ]` **Usability Testing (NFR1):**
        *   `[ ]` Get feedback from a few test users on ease of use.
    *   `[ ]` **Performance Testing (NFR2):**
        *   `[ ]` Test with target concurrent users (e.g., 5-10) to check message delay and stability.
    *   `[ ]` **Log Verification:**
        *   `[ ]` Manually inspect log files for correctness and completeness of join/leave and chat messages.
    *   `[ ]` **Bug Fixing:** Address issues found during testing.
    *   `[ ]` **Code Review & Refactoring:** Improve code quality and maintainability.

### Phase 5: Documentation & "Release" Preparation

**Goal:** Prepare the application for use by others on a local network.

*   **Tasks:**
    *   `[ ]` **User Documentation:**
        *   `[ ]` Simple `README.md` explaining:
            *   How to start the server.
            *   How clients can connect (specifying local IP and port).
            *   Basic usage instructions.
    *   `[ ]` **Deployment Preparation (NFR4):**
        *   `[ ]` If creating executables, set up the build process (e.g., PyInstaller for Python, Electron builder).
        *   `[ ]` Package any necessary assets (stickers).
    *   `[ ]` **Final Sanity Check:** One last run-through of the application.

## 4. Cross-Cutting Concerns (To be addressed throughout development)

*   **Simplicity:** Keep the design and implementation straightforward.
*   **Local Network Focus:** Avoid any external dependencies or internet calls.
*   **Code Comments & Readability:** Maintain clean and understandable code.

## 5. Future Considerations (Out of Scope for this plan)

*   User authentication (beyond nickname).
*   Private messaging.
*   Multiple chat rooms.
*   File sending (other than images).
*   Persistent chat history across server restarts.
*   Message editing/deletion.
*   Admin controls.
*   End-to-end encryption.
*   Auto-discovery of server (mDNS/Bonjour).

## 6. Tools

*   **Version Control:** Git
*   **IDE:** VS Code, PyCharm, etc.
*   **Communication:** (For team, if applicable)
*   **Issue Tracker:** GitHub Issues, Trello, Jira (if needed for larger team)
