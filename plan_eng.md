**1. Project Goal:**
To develop an application that automatically detects and visually displays potential Order Blocks (OBs) on cryptocurrency price charts. The detection logic will be based on the principles outlined in the "Order Block.pdf" and common Smart Money Concepts (SMC).

**2. Key Features:**
*   **Data Source:** Connect to cryptocurrency exchange APIs (e.g., Binance, Bybit, KuCoin) to fetch historical and real-time OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data.
*   **Pair & Timeframe Selection:** Allow users to select crypto pairs (e.g., BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT) and timeframes (e.g., 15m, 1H, 4H, 1D).
*   **Order Block Detection Algorithm:**
    *   Identify potential Bullish OBs (last down-candle before a significant up-move).
    *   Identify potential Bearish OBs (last up-candle before a significant down-move).
    *   Incorporate rules for "Break of Structure" (BOS) to validate the impulsive move.
    *   Optionally, identify associated Imbalances/Fair Value Gaps (FVGs) near the OB.
    *   Consider volume characteristics.
*   **Visualization:**
    *   Display OHLCV charts (candlestick).
    *   Clearly mark detected OBs on the chart (e.g., drawing a rectangle over the OB candle).
    *   Highlight the BOS.
*   **User Interface (UI):**
    *   Simple and intuitive interface for selections and viewing charts.
    *   (Optional Advanced) Settings panel for customizing OB detection parameters (e.g., minimum impulsive move percentage, lookback period for BOS).
*   **Alerts (Optional Advanced):**
    *   Notify users when a new OB is detected.
    *   Notify users when price retests a detected OB.

**3. Order Block Definition (Based on common understanding & PDF's likely focus):**
*   **Bullish OB:** The last bearish (down-close) candle before a strong bullish (upward) impulsive move that breaks a recent significant swing high.
*   **Bearish OB:** The last bullish (up-close) candle before a strong bearish (downward) impulsive move that breaks a recent significant swing low.
*   **Criteria for Impulsive Move:** A significant price movement that creates an imbalance (FVG) and/or breaks market structure.

**4. Technical Stack (Proposed):**
*   **Programming Language:** Python (due to its extensive libraries for data analysis, API interaction, and charting) or JavaScript (Node.js backend, React/Vue/Svelte frontend for a web app).
*   **Data Acquisition:** `ccxt` library (Python/JS) for exchange API integration.
*   **Data Handling:** Pandas (Python) for data manipulation and analysis.
*   **Charting:**
    *   Python: `mplfinance`, `Plotly Dash`, or `Bokeh`.
    *   JavaScript: `TradingView Lightweight Charts`, `Chart.js` with financial plugins, or `ApexCharts`.
*   **UI Framework (if desktop app):**
    *   Python: `PyQt5/6`, `Kivy`, `Tkinter` (basic).
    *   JavaScript (Desktop): Electron.
*   **Backend (if web app):** Flask/Django (Python) or Express.js (Node.js).
*   **Database (Optional, for storing user settings or historical OBs):** SQLite, PostgreSQL.

**5. Development Phases:**

*   **Phase 1: Core Logic & Data Handling (Proof of Concept)**
    *   [ ] Set up project environment and version control (Git).
    *   [ ] Implement API connection to fetch OHLCV data for a single pair/timeframe (e.g., Binance, BTC/USDT, 1H).
    *   [ ] Develop the algorithm to identify swing highs and swing lows (for BOS detection).
    *   [ ] Implement the core Order Block detection logic:
        *   [ ] Identify potential Bullish OB candles.
        *   [ ] Identify potential Bearish OB candles.
        *   [ ] Validate OBs based on subsequent Break of Structure.
    *   [ ] Basic console output or simple static chart (e.g., using `mplfinance`) to display detected OBs.

*   **Phase 2: Visualization & Basic UI**
    *   [ ] Choose and integrate a charting library.
    *   [ ] Display interactive candlestick charts.
    *   [ ] Visually mark detected OBs (rectangles) and BOS points/lines on the chart.
    *   [ ] Implement basic UI for selecting crypto pair and timeframe.

*   **Phase 3: Enhancements & User Experience**
    *   [ ] (Optional) Add FVG detection and visualization.
    *   [ ] (Optional) Add volume analysis to OB criteria.
    *   [ ] Refine OB detection parameters and allow user customization (if planned).
    *   [ ] Improve UI/UX based on initial testing.
    *   [ ] Error handling and logging.

*   **Phase 4: Advanced Features & Deployment (Optional)**
    *   [ ] Implement alert system (e.g., email, desktop notification).
    *   [ ] Support for multiple exchanges.
    *   [ ] (If web app) User authentication and data persistence.
    *   [ ] Backtesting module to test OB strategy effectiveness (highly complex).
    *   [ ] Packaging and deployment (e.g., PyInstaller for desktop, Docker for web).

**6. Data Flow (Simplified):**
    User Selects Pair/Timeframe -> App Fetches Data (API) -> Data Processed (Pandas) -> OB Algorithm Runs -> OBs Identified -> Results Displayed on Chart.

**7. Challenges & Considerations:**
*   **Defining "Significant" Move/BOS:** Quantifying what constitutes a strong impulsive move or a valid BOS can be subjective and require tuning.
*   **False Positives:** Automated systems might detect patterns that aren't true OBs in context.
*   **Repainting:** Ensure indicators/OBs do not "repaint" (change retroactively on closed candles). This is generally not an issue for OBs as they are based on past price action.
*   **API Rate Limits:** Handle exchange API rate limits gracefully.
*   **Real-time Data:** Handling real-time data updates for live detection requires robust architecture (e.g., WebSockets).
*   **Performance:** Processing large historical datasets or real-time data efficiently.
*   **Disclaimer:** The app is a tool for analysis, not financial advice. Trading involves risk.

**8. Next Steps:**
1.  Finalize the specific rules for OB detection from the "Order Block.pdf" if they differ significantly from common definitions.
2.  Start with Phase 1, focusing on data acquisition and the core detection algorithm.
3.  Iteratively develop and test each feature.
